# Gupta Track Reco Repo V1



## Getting started

Git Repo for Track reconstruction using Gupta functions

List of directories in the repo
- [ ] data: Stores the networks weights and gcd files
- [ ] extract data from i3files: Scripts to convert i3 files to formats required for training and inferencing
- [ ] fitting: Stores scripts for the likelihood fitter
- [ ] lib: Stores config files for the network and inferences
- [ ] training_network: Stores the scripts required for training and evaluation of the trained network



```
NOTE: 
- [ ] These scripts contain hardcoded paths
- [ ] The imports likely would be needed to be re-configured as the files are stored in their relevant directories

```

If you there are comments/questions/suggestion on the running the script, contact Rishi Babu (rbabu@icecube.wisc.edu)
